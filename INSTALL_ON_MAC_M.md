# Installation on Mac (M chip)

## System Requirements

Download and install Ovito Basic: https://www.ovito.org/

You must have Python 3 with `pip` and `conda` installed on your system.



Open Terminal application. Check if you have Python 3 and conda:
```bash
python3 --version # should print the version number
python3 -m pip --version # should print the version number
conda --version # should print the version number
```
If Python 3 is missing, follow the installation instructions from [the Python official website](https://www.python.org/). If you have Python 3.4 or later, `pip` is included by default.

If `conda` is missing, follow [these instructions](https://www.anaconda.com/docs/getting-started/miniconda/install) to install Miniconda.
