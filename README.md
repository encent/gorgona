# Gorgona: a python-based tool for intestinal environment simulations with lammps

The simulation tool was developed within T3.6 of the 3D'omics project. For usage examples see `examples/01_generation_pipeline` and `examples/01_analysis_pipeline`. For LAMMPS and OVITO installation instructions see `INSTALL.md`. Gorgona requires only LAMMPS, matplotlib, numpy and pandas libraries. To install Gorgona into your environment simply use this command: `pip install -e .` after cloning and `cd` into this repo.
